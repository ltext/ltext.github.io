      If you toyed around with the <code>apply</code> function from earlier, you
      may have seen a daunting error:
    </p>
    <pre>
$ <span style="color: #00AD9C;">ltext</span> <span style="color: #E07B53;">"\f -> apply f bar"</span>
[Print Error] Can't print textual data while residually inside an expression:
Abs "f" (Concat (Lit ["###"]) (App (Var "f") (Abs "some" (Abs "content"
  (Abs "that" (Abs "I" (Lit ["###"])))))))</pre>
    <p>
      This is intended! This makes sure that the templates we render are actually
      <em>renderable</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In laymen's terms, a template can only be rendered if <strong>all</strong>
      <code>Text</code> data that is concatenated (<code>&lt;&gt;</code>) is at the
      "top level" - if after reducing our expression, we wind up applying text to
      an unknown function, or applying unknown input to a file, we can't fully
      substitute the text, and are left with dangling references to files.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can check the type of these expressions, but we can't render them. This
      process will improve in the future, but for now just make sure `ltext` is used
      to concatenate files completely, and not expect partial application to
      "just work".
    </p>
    <p>
      So, if you ever get this error, you know that there's something you still need
      to apply before you can fully render your expression.
